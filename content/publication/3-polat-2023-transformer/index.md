abstract: In this study, an innovative approach is explored that combines Density Functional Tight Binding (DFTB) with Computer Vision (CV) techniques to analyze the electronic structure and enhance the photocatalytic capabilities of carbon-doped titanium oxide nanoparticles (C-doped TiO₂ NPs). The findings reveal that C doping, in levels ranging from 0.1% to 0.6%, progressively alters the material’s electronic structure and photocatalytic activity. Specifically, the energy gap decreases significantly from 3.160 eV for undoped TiO₂ to 0.565 eV at 0.6% doping, with no substantial changes observed beyond 0.6% doping. A notable correlation between increased C doping and a rise in total energy suggests a complex interaction between C incorporation and the energetic as well as structural dynamics of TiO₂ NPs. This interaction could enhance photocatalytic efficiency, especially under visible light, by reducing the band gap through C doping. The use of CV methodologies improves computational efficiency and predictive accuracy. These techniques validate the DFTB results and accelerate the material discovery process via machine learning models.
